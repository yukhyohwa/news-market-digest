### The Guardian view on Trump’s raid in Caracas: oil matters, but it’s not the whole story | Editorial

> <p>The seizure of Venezuelan leader was induced by the prize of petroleum, but driven by spectacle, geopolitics and domestic politics</p><p>It’s all about oil. That was the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/12/the-guardian-view-on-trump-and-venezuela-a-return-to-seeking-regime-change">reason</a> Nicolás Maduro, the Venezuelan leader<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2026/jan/04/the-guardian-view-on-the-us-seizure-of-maduro-trump-has-turned-the-worlds-superpower-into-a-rogue-state"> illegally abducted</a> by US forces at the weekend, had given for Donald Trump’s fixation with his country. A better way to think about Venezuela&nbsp;is that oil was necessary but not sufficient. The presence of <a href="https://adamtooze.substack.com/p/chartbook-423-some-topical-material">vast reserves</a> made Mr Trump’s interest understandable – if Venezuela’s main export was bananas this would not have happened. But oil alone cannot explain&nbsp;the timing or scale of the move.</p><p>Venezuelan crude is extra-heavy as well as expensive and slow to bring online; it will not immediately transform US energy systems, nor <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2026/jan/05/venezuelan-crude-oil-appeals-to-us-refineries">rescue</a> refineries that have already adapted to years without it. Instead, oil is the “prize” around which other <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/06/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-jonathan-blitzer.html">agendas cohere</a>. These include future profits for US firms; modest downward pressure on oil prices; depriving China of a meaningful ally in America’s backyard; putting pressure on Cuba; and US domestic political signalling in Florida. Each gain is small. But collectively Mr Trump could justify a high‑profile, theatrical – and unlawful – intervention even if the economic returns are incremental.</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

### The Guardian view on universities: Labour needs a clearer plan | Editorial

> <p>Ministers promised a ‘change of approach’, but their new tax could tip weaker institutions over the edge</p><p>Education opens doors, and the expansion of higher education begun under New Labour means that millions of young people who would not previously have gone from school to university have now done so. From 336,000 places accepted in 1997, the total rose by 68% to 563,000 in 2022. In last year’s student experience survey, <a href="https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/knowledge-hub/student-academic-experience-survey-2025">just 11% of undergraduates</a> said that they regretted their decision to take a degree.</p><p>In an interview with this newspaper at the weekend, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2026/jan/03/uk-university-degree-no-longer-passport-to-social-mobility-says-kings-vice-chancellor">Prof Shitij Kapur</a>, the vice-chancellor of King’s College London, stressed that one consequence of this increased access has been that degrees no longer confer a virtually automatic graduate job. His likening of a degree to a visa – or a “chance” rather than a guarantee – was striking, and he is right that the increased difficulties of graduates in finding suitable work must be taken seriously. Along with rising student debt and the less favourable terms now attached to loans, this tighter graduate job market explains why, having reached Tony Blair’s target of 50% in 2017, the proportion of young people now going to university has since fallen.</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

### 委内瑞拉事件如何强化习近平在亚洲的权力愿景
